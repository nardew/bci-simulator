# Bitpanda Crypto Index Simulator

Bitpanda Crypto Index (BCI) is an index product offered by the Austrian crypto broker bitpanda. The index consits of preselected crypto assets based on their actual market capitalization and gets recalculated (rebalanced) monthly to reflect shifts in the market. For full description read the [prospectus](https://cdn.bitpanda.com/media/bci/Prospectus_Index_English.pdf).

This package serves to simulate BCI calculation, determine its composition and perform monthly rebalancing based on the historical input data in order to calculate yield and compare it with the returns resulting from holding the original assets without any rebalancing. This may help decide whether investing in the index is profitable or at least help compare performance with different parameters.

The package tries to simulate BCI rules as much as possible but this cannot be achieved 100% due to certain steps being not explicitly described in the prospectus and bitpanda reserving rights to potentially adjust the rules fully at their sole discretion. Nevertheless, outcome of the simulation still provides valuable insight into mechanics of the index and its evolution over time.

This simulator is highly configurable but it comes with readymade configuration scripts for `BCI5` and `BCI10` indices (see `bci5.sh` and `bci10.sh`).

Calculation is performed based on the historical data provided in JSON format. The repository already contains a sample input file `input_data.json` which contains prices, market capitalizations and volumes of all cryptocurrencies since 01/01/2015 up to 01/11/2020 as published by `CoinGecko`.

To summarize the results, given current and past cryptomarket conditions investing into crypto indices <ins>at the moment</ins> is questionable. Unlike standard assets, crypto currencies are extremely correlated which defeats diversification. Furthermore, fat tail distribution implies that a few leading currencies drive performance of the index all the time. Based on several executions with various parameters you are often better off distributing initial funds into a few top currencies and sticking to them. More in the section with results. The index would be advantageous in case of sudden uncorrelated crash of one of the top performers. If this is what you are trying to protect from, then index is the right thing for you.

Disclaimer: I am by no means affiliated with bitpanda (though I have been their customer for a couple of years) and this project was developed for personal purposes. 

### Example

I will demonstrate `BCI5` simulation by executing `bci5.sh` for a period of two months with a single rebalancing and explain the output. Numbers are rounded for sake of readibility.

### Results


As already mentioned in the introduction, BCI5 and BCI10's performance depends on the parameters and timeframe used. While it performs well when bought prior to the 2017 bull run, it underperformes when entered later. There are several factors responsible for this, mainly strong correlation between BTC and other leading currencies and dilution of the few top performing coins due to rebalancing despite their price outperforming other assets.
In the following paragraphs I provide performance of indices executed with different parameters and comparison with a diverse portfolio without rebalancing. Each simulation starts with $1000 and applies 2% fee. All values are shown without fees.

### Implemented BCI rules

To verify the correct methodology was used to simulate `BCI` indices, hereunder the implemented rebalancing rules are outlined. In particular, `BCI5` is used for illustration.

- put all currencies from the current index with average daily volume >= $600,000 over past 30 days into the list of index candidates 
- put remaining currencies ordered by market capitalization with average daily volume >= $1,000,000 over past 30 days into the list of index candidates
- put top three currencies from the candidate list into the final index
- put additional two currencies from the candidate list such that currencies from the existing index placed up to the 7th place have priority
- normalize weights according to the market capitalization
- cap allocation to 35% and renormalize (the step can be performed several times)
